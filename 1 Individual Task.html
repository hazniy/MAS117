    <h2>Two rooks</h2>
		<p>
            A program that took random choices for placing two rooks 
            in different squares of the chessboard. It would print out 
            the location of both rooks with non-challenging configuration.

    <h4>The Logic behind the code</h4>
        <p> 
            We split the code into 3 important parts, which are 
            to allocate the location of both rooks and consider 
            that both rooks don't fall under the same column and 
            row, which has been done in line 9. We assign an empty 
            array for the rook_location to make sure it's in 
            a non-challenging configuration. Then, we can start 
            the outline of the chessboard, which was taught in the 
            previous computer class. We now need to assign black and 
            white squares alternately. To make this work, the remainder 
            of the row and column must be 1 to assign black, and 
            vice versa for white (line 21). We now use plt.text 
            (reference add text python matplotlib) to locate each rook.
        </p>
    <h2>Modify version</h2>
		<p>
			It increments a sizeable amount of times and prints 
            out the fraction of configurations that are non-challenging.

        <h4>The Logic behind the code</h4>
        <p>
            Now we would have to determine the 
            fraction for non-challenging configurations
            We have a function `rooks_proportion` which accepts 
            number of trials as parameter (line 4). Following this, 
            we have a new variable `non_challenging_count', which 
            counts for how many times a non-challenging configuration 
            appears for each number of trials. The important part is line 10 
            that compares every row and column for the first and second rooks 
            to check whether they fall under the same row or the same column. 
            In the case they do not fall under the same row and column, it 
            will increment the `non_challenging_count by 1. This will keep 
            repeating until the total number of trials is achieved.

		<h2>The maths behind it</h2>
            <p><ul><li>The first rook can be placed on any one of the $64$ 
                squares of the board. Hence, the second rook may fall on 
                one of the remaining $63$ squares, because it cannot fall 
                in a position of the already placed first rook (Figure 1).
                Hence the total ways of placing two rooks on the board 
                is $64.63 = 4032$ This number will include challenging 
                and non-challenging configurations. </li></p>
            <p><li> The Non challenging configurations would be when the 
                two rooks are in the different rows and different columns. 
                To count these we use the following reasoning 
                <p><ol><li>The first can go on any of the $64$ squares.</p></li>
                <p><li>For the second rook to be at a non-attacking 
                    position, it must be in a different row and a 
                    different column. Since one row and one column is 
                    already occupied by the first rook, there are $7$ 
                    choices for the row and $7$ choices for the column 
                    for the second rook. Thus, the number of non-attacking 
                    configurations is $64.7.7 = 3136$</li></p>
            </ol></p></li>
            <p><li>To find the number of challenging configurations, 
                we simply take the total number of configurations and 
                subtract the non challenging ones, $4032 - 3136 = 896$.</li></p>
            <p><li>The probability, within the simulation context, that a 
                random placement is non-challenging is $P(non-challenging) 
                = \frac{Number of non-challenging configurations}{Total number 
                    of configurations} = \frac{3136}{4032} = 0.78$. That would 
                    suggest that about $78%$ of random placements of two rooks 
                    are non-challenging. P/S It isn't an exact $78%$ non-challenging 
                    configurations are to be derived every time (Figure 3). This has to do 
                    with the number of placements that were allowed for the rooks 
                    in each simulation and how 'random' the selections have been 
                    made. It is, however, constrained by simple mathematics-the 
                    ratio of the number of non-challenging configurations versus 
                    the total possible-to never rise above $78%$. The number of 
                    non-challenging configurations relates to the total possible, 
                    and thus it can never go over a ratio value of about $78%$. </li></p>
            <p><li>Well, the Law of Large Numbers says that the more trials 
                you do, the closer the average of the results will get to 
                the expected value. For the simulation, this means the more 
                simulations run, the closer the proportion of non-challenging 
                configurations will be to the theoretical probability of $0.78$.</li></p>
            </ul>

        <h4>The logic behind the code</h4>
        <p> Now, the code is similar to the previous one but with 
            a few adjustments. Line 11 has been added to assign 
            the third rook's location. The comparison is made in 
            the same way as the previous code (line 13).
        </p>
        <h3>Maths explanation</h3>
        <p>This allows combinatorics to provide us the count of the number of 
            non-challenging configurations to put three rooks that no two of 
            them are located in the same row or in the same column (Figure 4). Since 
            first one has to choose $3$ rows out of the total of $8$ available 
            that can be done in $\binom{3}{8} = 56$ ways. Similarly, we have 
            to choose $3$ columns out of the $8$, and this also can be done in 
            $\binom{8}{3}=56$ ways.Once the rows and columns are chosen, in 
            the selected rows and columns, the three rooks can be arranged 
            in $3! = 6$ ways, because the first rook has $3$ column options, the 
            second rook has $2$, and the third has $1$. The total number of 
            non-challenging configurations is then $\binom{8}{3}.\binom{8}{3}.3! 
            = 56.56.6 = 18 816$. We now have to find the probability of the 
            non-attacking configuration. Let us first get the number of ways 
            one can place $3$ rooks at random on the board. That would be the 
            number of ways of choosing $3$ squares out of the $64$ squares of the 
            chessboard which is $\binom{64}{3} = 41 664$.Then the probability 
            of a non-attacking configuration is given by the ratio of 
            non-attacking configurations to the total configurations, that is, 
            $P(non-challenging) = \frac{18 816}{41 664} = 0.45$.Thus, there is a 
            $45%$ chance that a random placement of 3 rooks on the chessboard will 
            result in a non-attacking configuration (Figure 5).
