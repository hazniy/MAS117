        <p>One of the most famous mathematical problems 
            debated concerning whether any such sequence 
            of moves is plausible is the Knight's Tour problem. 
            In a sense, this problem provides an immediate application 
            of the Knight's Tour, where the knight must step in turn 
            on successive knight moves without stepping onto the same 
            square again. A complete tour means stepping on all squares 
            once, whereas a closed complete tour would mean ending on a 
            square sufficiently near to this configuration for the 
            knight to return to the starting square.

    <h2>The Base</h2>
    <h2>Chessboard and Knight</h2>
		<p>
            This program describes the code to implement a chessboard with a knight.
        </p>
    
	<h3>A Python program</h3>

        </div>
    <h4>The Logic behind the code</h4>
        <p> 
            We have two functions, one for the chessboard 
            and another for the knight. The chessboard function 
            is very important in two respects: displaying 
            the outlines of the chessboard and displaying the 
            black and white squares of a standard chessboard. 
            The chessboard behaves like an $8x8$ grid. Random numbers 
            were used to test some positions for the knight, and it 
            has been found reasonable to position it by taking row 
            value minus $7.5$. 
        </p>
    <h2>Knight Moves Randomly</h2>
		<p>
			So by now, in this program, we randomly motion the piece whenever the user clicks.
		</p>

			</code>
		</pre>
        <h4>The Logic behind the code</h4>
        <p>
            Another function called 'user_click' has been created, 
            and it is called by the program to provide response 
            to the user click events. This is where we create our 
            two variable values, row and column (col). When these 
            variables are assigned hearing values, the knight position
            will be updated. This is the beauty of get_current_figure() 
            (plt.gcf()). After that, we made plt.gcf().canvas.mpl_connect 
            listen for user interaction events like mouse clicks.

        <h4>The logic behind the code</h4>
        <p> The purpose is to code the identification of all 
            the knight L-shaped tour possible moves. Some functions 
            are going to be relooked one by one. The first is the 
            validation method, checking if the move is within the 
            boundaries of the board and is not already visited. 
            The next_move function finds all knight valid moves 
            from the current position. The knight function was modified 
            to display the possible moves. The user_click function was 
            slightly modified to check whether the clicked-on position 
            is a valid move. After each possible move, the board will 
            be redrawn with the new position and repeated till there 
            are no valid moves left for the user to click on. 
            The total moves will be displayed. 

            We realized that a problem so far is requiring the user to click 
            on an exact region to move the knight. This may require multiple 
            clicks because, after all, the program assumes that the user 
            probably made a mistake in clicking a square. The fundamental 
            reason behind the incurred problem appears to be the loss of accuracy. 
            Hence we found clicking exactly at the bottom of the highlighted 
            circle, only then does the knight move correctly.

		<h2>How to determine the correct next move of the knight?</h2>
            <p><ul><li><h4>Graph theory</h4>Graph theory gives us insight 
                into the knight's movement across a chessboard. Each of the squares 
                is thought of as the nodes in a graph, and each 
                legal knight move corresponds to an edge between
                two nodes. The knight's movement proceeds in "L" shapes: 
                two squares in one direction and one square in a 
                direction perpendicular. Because of this, from any 
                square in the middle of the board, barring the edges 
                or corners, there could be up to eight different 
                possible moves, while fewer than eight available 
                moves are possible from some squares.  </li></p>
            <p><li><h4>Hamiltonian path</h4>In the glossary of graph theory, such a path is 
                referred to as a Hamiltonian path. If a knight can 
                return to its original square after traversing 
                every square, it will form a Hamiltonian cycle. 
                This is notoriously difficult, it is impractical 
                to evaluate even a meaningful subset of paths as 
                the size of the board grows and the number of paths 
                increases massively really fast. </li></p>
            <p><li><h4>Challenges of Hamiltonian cycle</h4>
                The main difficulty in this case arises from the 
                rather imbalanced connectivities of those nodes. 
                Some squares especially those near the center of 
                the board offer way more move options than those 
                near the edges. This imbalance makes the consideration 
                of finding an acceptable path likely to visit every 
                square interfere with the knight's movement. One of 
                the common heuristics used to assist the knight in 
                completing the Hamiltonian path would be Warnsdorff's Rule. </li></p>
            <p><li><h4>Warnsdorff's Rule</h4>
                Warnsdorff's Rule relates to the heuristic method for 
                arriving at the solution more effectively by shortening 
                the possibilities at any step of the Knight's tour problem. 
                It works based on a simple and very efficient idea: 
                the knight goes to the square from which it has the 
                fewest onward moves. In this way, the knight avoids being 
                trapped in the parts of the board that do not allow access to most, 
                if all, of the squares.</li></p>

        <h2>Maths Explanation</h2>
        <p>
            An $n.n$ chessboard will have $n^2$ squares,
            this can also be counted to verify. If a knight happens 
            to start on any square, the next thing to determine is 
            the number of ways of visiting the remaining $n^2 -1$ squares, 
            which is given by the permutation formula $P = (n^2 -1)!$. 
            There would be a total of $8.8=64$ squares on the 
            standard chessboard, and therefore after starting, 
            the number of permutations on the remaining $63$ 
            squares by the knight would equal $P = 63! = 4.33.10^{86}$ 
            a huge number indeed. Thus this stands impractical for 
            calculation for larger chessboards. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If a knight is placed on a central square, then it can make up 
            to 8 moves, on approaching edges, the possibilities start 
            winding down, and finally corner moves provide you with fewer 
            options. Therefore counting the allowed moves to be determined 
            from any square by means of a position $C = \binom{8}{n}$
            where n is the number of legal moves afforded at the 
            position of the knight.
            $C =\binom{8}{8}= 1$, if C is on Central. 
            $C =\binom{8}{4}= 70$, if C is on edge.
