#introduction of knight tours
#This "game" is basically an implementation of Knight's Tour problem.
#You have to produce the longest possible sequence of moves of a
#chess knight, while visiting squares on the board only once.
#This sequence is called "tour". If your tour visits every square,
#then you have achieved a full tour. If you have achieved a full tour
#and from your last position you could move to your initial square,
#then you have achieved a closed full tour.
#Currently occupied square is highlighted in pale blue,
# while possible moves are shown with pale green. Click on the
# currently occupied square to undo.
