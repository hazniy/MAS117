Let $ f(x) = \frac{e^x}{1-x} $. 
Here it is bigger on a new line:
\[
	f(x) = \frac{e^x}{1-x}. Then
\]
Here is the derivative: 
\[
	f'(x) = {(1-x)^2e^x}{e^x(1-x)6^-1}
\]
Here is an integral: 
\[
	\int_0^\pi \cos(x) \,dx = [\sin(x)]_0^\pi
\]
\[
	= \sin(x) + c
\]

% \section to put section
Differentiate $f(x) = e^x \cos x $, then find the derivative at $ x = \frac{\pi}{4} $.
% we can put $ or \(...\) or \[...\] or \begin{align*} for math mode
\section{Solution}
Firstly, we need to apply the product rule:
\[
\frac{d}{dx}[uv] = u'v + uv'
\]

From the question and the product rule above, we need to differentiate $u = e^x \) and \( v = \cos x$ first. We will get the derivative like this: 
\[
u' =  e^x
\]
\[
v' = -\sin x.
\]

After that, we need to apply the product rule which we will get like this: 
\begin{align*}
	f'(x) 
	&= e^x \cos x + e^x (-\sin x) \\
	&= e^x (\cos x - \sin x).
\end{align*}

Lastly, we can calculate the expression that we get at $ x = \frac{\pi}{4} $.  We know that $ \cos \frac{\pi}{4} = \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} $. Substituting this into the derivative:

\begin{align*}
	f'( \frac{\pi}{4}) 
	&= e^{\frac{\pi}{4}} ( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}})\\ 
	&= e^{\frac{\pi}{4}} \cdot 0 \\
	&= 0.
\end{align*}

The final answer at $x = \frac{\pi}{4} $ is 0.
