A friend recommended I read some books~\cite{Lessing:Notebook} by Doris Lessing, starting with one of her most famous books. I spent six hours straight just eating up the content of this book~\cite{Coho:iewu}. And I think it's safe to say those six hours changed my life.  This book was an EXTREMELY fast-paced read for me since I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. 
Wiles was the person who proved Fermat's Last Theorem~\cite[Theorem~2.1]{Wiles:fermats-theorem}. %specific page/chapt of book
